            <p class="section-subtitle">Effective as of February 27, 2026</p>

            <p>Socialnetworkcreator is committed to maintaining robust privacy protections for its users. This Privacy Policy explains in clear terms the categories of information we collect, why we collect it, how we use it, when we share it, and how you can exercise your rights.</p>

            <p>For purposes of this Policy, “Site” refers to our website and “Service” refers to Socialnetworkcreator services provided through the Site that enable users to communicate, share messages, and collaborate. The terms “we,” “us,” and “our” refer to Socialnetworkcreator. “You” refers to a user of the Site or Service. By accessing our Site or using the Service you accept this Privacy Policy and our Terms of Use.</p>

            <h3>I. Information We Collect</h3>

            <!-- REPLACED / EXPANDED COLLECTION SECTION (long, explicit) -->
            <p>We collect several types of information to operate our Service reliably and safely. The categories below describe the data we gather when you use our Site and the Service. This section replaces and expands any shorter list previously provided so you have a comprehensive picture of what we collect.</p>

            <h4>1. Information You Provide Directly</h4>
            <p>When you register for an account or update your account settings, we collect information you provide directly to us. This includes your full name or display name, email address, username, chosen password (stored securely as described in our security section), profile photo or avatar, profile biography, and any other information that you voluntarily add to your profile.</p>
            <p>We also collect identity documents and identifiers in cases where identity verification is required. For example, if you use features that require age verification, KYC (know-your-customer) checks for payments, or identity verification for moderators or owners, we may collect a government-issued ID (such as a passport, driver’s license, or national ID). We collect these documents only when necessary, and only with your explicit consent at the time of collection.</p>
            <p>We collect payment information if you make purchases or subscribe to paid features. Payment data is processed by our third-party payment processors; we may store transaction references and billing contact information but do not store full card numbers on our servers unless you explicitly opt into a saved-payment feature that is protected by strong encryption and the permissions you grant.</p>
            <p>If you contact support or otherwise communicate with us (for example by email, chat, or support ticket), we collect the content of your messages and any attachments you provide. We keep these records to provide support and to maintain a history for quality and safety purposes.</p>

            <h4>2. Information Collected Automatically</h4>
            <p>When you interact with the Site or Service we automatically collect information about your device and your use. This includes your IP address, device identifiers, browser type and version, operating system, screen resolution, language settings, the pages or features you interact with, timestamps, and log data about actions you take on the Site.</p>
            <p>We use cookies, local storage, and similar technologies to remember preferences, enable authentication, and analyze usage. Cookies may be session-based or persistent. Cookies help us detect repeat visits, prevent fraud, and provide a smoother experience (for example by keeping you logged in when you choose that option).</p>
            <p>We may collect location data if you enable location-based features. Location data can be precise (GPS-level) only if you grant explicit permission; otherwise we infer location from IP address at a city or region level for analytics and compliance purposes.</p>

            <h4>3. Information from Third Parties and Public Sources</h4>
            <p>We may enrich or verify information about you using third-party services. This can include public profile data from identity providers (when you sign in with Google or other providers), social profile information you agree to share, or records from fraud prevention services. We receive only the information required to provide the requested feature and we use it under the controls described in this policy.</p>
            <p>We may also collect information that others share about you. For example, if another user includes your contact details when inviting you to the Service, we will process that information to send the invitation and may retain limited metadata for audit and abuse prevention.</p>

            <h4>4. Sensitive and Special Categories</h4>
            <p>We do not generally collect sensitive personal data (such as health, biometric, or religious data) unless you submit it voluntarily as part of your content or where a feature explicitly requires it and you consent. If you provide such information, we treat it in accordance with your consent and applicable law and we will inform you before collection.</p>

            <h4>5. How We Use Identifying Information</h4>
            <p>We use identifying information like your email address and any ID documents you voluntarily provide to create and secure your account, verify your identity when needed, prevent abuse on the platform, comply with legal obligations (such as payment and KYC rules), and to enable features that require identity verification (for example, moderator verification or certain marketplace features).</p>
            <p>We use email addresses for account creation, login and password reset flows, sending transactional messages (receipts, security notices), and for marketing messages only when you opt into those communications. You may unsubscribe from marketing emails at any time; administrative messages are not optional and will be sent to your registered email address.</p>

            <h4>6. Why We Collect These Items</h4>
            <p>Collecting email and identity documents allows us to reduce fraud, protect our community, and comply with applicable laws. Collecting device and usage data helps us improve performance, detect malicious activity, measure feature adoption, and make product decisions. Payment and billing information is collected to process transactions and to prevent payment fraud.</p>

            <h4>7. Retention and Minimization</h4>
            <p>We retain personal information for as long as necessary to provide the Service and for legitimate business purposes, including preventing fraud, complying with legal obligations, and resolving disputes. We apply data minimization principles: we request only information necessary for the purpose and do not keep extraneous details beyond reasonable retention periods unless required for legal reasons.</p>

            <h4>8. Your Choices About Collection</h4>
            <p>You can choose not to provide optional information, but some features may not work without certain data. You can control cookies and local storage via your browser settings, and you can delete or update profile information from your account settings. For identity documents, you must provide them only when the feature requires verification; you can refuse, but that may prevent use of the verified features.</p>

            <h4>9. Example Data Elements We Collect (concise list)</h4>
            <ul>
                <li>Contact: email address, phone number when provided.</li>
                <li>Identifiers: username, account ID, device identifiers, IP address.</li>
                <li>Identity verification data: government-issued ID, identity photos, verification metadata (only with consent).</li>
                <li>Profile: display name, avatar, bio, profile links.</li>
                <li>Usage: logs, timestamps, features used, messages you post or upload.</li>
                <li>Payment: billing name, billing address, transaction IDs (payment processors hold card data).</li>
                <li>Support: messages, attachments, diagnostic logs you provide to support.</li>
            </ul>

            <p>These items are collected and processed in order to operate the Service, enhance safety, and comply with legal and contractual obligations. If you have questions about a specific field we collect, contact us and we will explain how it is used and how long we retain it.</p>
